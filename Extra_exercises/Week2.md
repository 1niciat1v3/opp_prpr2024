# Bonus exercises week 2

### Bonus 1 - Weighted Average:

Write a program which will calculate weighted average of 5 subjects. Each grade is a  real number from range <1.0; 5.0> and weight is integer from range <1;5>. The input is in format `<grade> <weight> <grade> <weight> <grade> <weight> <grade> <weight> <grade> <weight>`. The output is real number rounded to 2 decimal places.

**Example input:** 2.2 1 3.5 4 1.1 2 4.2 3 5.0 1

**Example output:** The weighted average is: 3.27

**Challenge:** Calculate weighted average of N <1;100> subjects, where N is user inputted number

### Bonus 2 - Sum of Even and Odd Numbers

Write a program that calculated the sum of odd and even numbers separately. 10 integer numbers are inputted

**Example input:** 2 1 -5 4 -8 -4 -7 5 4 1

**Example output:** <br> Sum of odd numbers: -6 <br> Sum of even numbers: -2

**Challenge:** Instead of 10 numbers, calculate sums for N numbers, where N is the amount of numbers inputted

### Bonus 3 - Prime Number Finder

Write a program that reads an integer N <1; 100> from the user and finds all prime numbers less than or equal to N. The program should output the list of prime numbers and the total count of primes

**Example input:** 20

**Example output:** <br> Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 <br> Total primes: 8
